# Car Price Prediction Problem
Design a Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Car Prices 

## Problem Statement
A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market. The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car How well those variables describe the price of a car

## Goal of this assignment
To model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
